Showcase how to use NFT.storage for storing metadata &amp; data for NFT. NFT.storage offers a convenient solution to store NFT metadata on both IPFS & FileCoin for free. This npm helps you do that with one or two lines of code. You can ignore the warning in v14.x node.js onwards but it works. You need to get a free API_KEY from <https://nft.storage/>.

## Setup

You need to create a .env file with the following setup.

```text
API_KEY="REPLACE-API-KEY"
```

Once done, the following commands will help you run

```bash
npm install
node script.js
```
